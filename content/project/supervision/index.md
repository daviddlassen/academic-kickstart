I supervise BA and M.Sc. theses in Social Data Science, Behavioral Economics, and Political Economics.

In social data science, projects often combine machine learning and prediction with social science topics. These projects are often based on data from the public sector or industry and we can often facilitate contact with such partners. Get in touch if interested.
