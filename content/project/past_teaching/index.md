In the past, I have taught M.Sc.-level courses on Political economics, Public expenditure policy, and International political economy from a corporate perspective. I have taught seminars on Political economics, Conflict economics, Media economics, and Public economics. At one point I taught B.Sc. Advanced Microeconomics. Feel free to get in touch if you want information about any of these courses.
